    <p>(<em>from</em> Hamlet,<em> spoken by Hamlet)</em></p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To be, or not to be, that is the question:
      <br />
      Whether 'tis nobler in the mund to suffer
      <br />
      The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
      <br />
      Or to take arms against a sea of trouble
      <br />
      And by opposing end them. To die--to sleep,
      <br />
      No more; and by a sleep to say we end
      <br />
      The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
      <br />
      That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
      <br />
      Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep,
      <br />
      To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye there's the rub,
    </p>
